'Plus Sigils' is my second attempt at making mods. After giving up on MagicPlus I decided to make this abomination.

Basically, this mod adds items increasing the difficulty of the game; these range from capping your
HP or Speed to removing critical hits to making bosses be much faster and stronger than ever.

To keep you from suffering from these challenges, this also adds some helpful items, such as crystals
increasing your defense, speed, mana and health above their normal caps.
(might not be balanced with other mods doing the same thing)

As of version 1.0.1:

- 100/10 HP Sigils; permamently caps your health at 10 or 100 HP.
- Mana Nullifier Sigil; removes your mana completely.
